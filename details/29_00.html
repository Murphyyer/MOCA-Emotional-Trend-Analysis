  <p>year they have people come here and pick up the students, the international students. They took us to Clarion, the road was zigzag, and it was so cold in the snow, and I don&#x27;t know what my feeling was. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. When I got there, a very nice lady told me, &quot;We have some Chinese students here.&quot; And she gave me one phone number, and I called up and he was from Beijing, too. And apparently he said, &quot;I&#x27;ll drive over there. We have other new students, too. And we&#x27;ll see if we can find you a place to live.&quot; You know that&#x27;s the first thing, and --  RUF: How about the food? A lot of people have told me they had difficulties adjusting to food. Did you have similar problems?  ANONYMOUS: If I&#x27;d been in New York, it wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem. I was in Pennsylvania, and at home my mom cooked, and I knew some, but not that great.</p>
