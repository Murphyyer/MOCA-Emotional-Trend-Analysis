  <p>And I was stuck eating noodles for two weeks in Pennsylvania. I got to sick of it, and of course other things, too. American food, now I really like some of American food, but at that point --  RUF: Like what?  ANONYMOUS: I like Italian food.  RUF: More noodles.  ANONYMOUS: I like lasagna, parmesan. Are you Italian?  RUF: No, but I love Italian food too! Ooh!  ANONYMOUS: And my friend took me to Italian restaurants, Scallopina and stuff like that. And I like pastas, too. And spaghetti, too. But at that point, I didn&#x27;t know what to eat. Just, a, make something, it&#x27;s not Chinese food and not American food. I cooked one dish, the same dish, for another two weeks and got sick of it. And eventually, now, I can cook a very good dinner now. Chinese style. But at that point I didn&#x27;t know, I wasn&#x27;t trained to do those things</p>
