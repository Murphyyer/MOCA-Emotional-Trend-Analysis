  <p>like to leave. Not only because of Chinese food, but a lot of other activities. For example, last Saturday night, in Central Park the Pavarotis. Even though I didn&#x27;t go, there were 400,000 people who went. I didn&#x27;t go there, but there are Broadway shows and galleries.  RUF: What do you do in your leisure time? Do you go to shows, have you visited galleries?  ANONYMOUS: Yes. But shows rarely, because they&#x27;re so expensive. On our anniversary we went to a Broadway show, once. And we went to Rockefeller Center to see people skating over there. There&#x27;s a certain atmosphere, cultural atmosphere, which you can&#x27;t get anywhere else. Are you from New York?  RUF: I&#x27;ve lived here for ten years I grew up in what they call Upstate New York. My parents were born and raised here, so I knew New York pretty well as a child. And what else do you do in your spare time?  ANONYMOUS: Actually, what I liked to do before, I really don&#x27;t do anymore.</p>
